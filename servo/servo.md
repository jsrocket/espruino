Kens Servo Module
===========

I built this module initially because I could not get my servos to rotate to complete 0 or 180 degrees. They would always stop short no matter the brand I used. 

I also added some other features to this module that the main Espruino module does not have including:

 - an init funciton to set the initial starting position
 - the ability for the servo to hold a certain position before turning off
 - a function to get the current position the servo thinks it's at.
